# 3D-Cellular-Automata
Computation and rendering of the next state is done on the GPU.

Message for colleges to which I'm applying:
While this was uploaded to GitHub in October, this is in fact a project I started and finished in quarantine/summer. I put it on GitHub and created a GitHub pages (https://bglobb.github.io/3D-Cellular-Automata) in October and made it website-ready for the college application (as I did with most of the other projects I have in my application). However, I couldn't help but make optimizations and add features, so I did add and change quite a bit to it in the first 3 days of November.
